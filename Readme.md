### Description
This is my term project for OOP at UNH. I'm a pretty average C++ programmer and this is an advanced course so I will be tackling
new concepts; some of which may seem counter intuitive to a standard program for the sake of learning. See the documentation folder for more about each assignment.

### DONE(?)
## Class Assignments
